Test abventure - The first line is always the abventure name.

    %Item Declaring items can be done anywhere, but it is recommended to do so at the tippy top of the file.
    %Torch A lit torch that gives up enough light to light up the whole room.
    %Shovel A crude shovel with some dried dirt on it.
    %Ring-of-insight A ring that reveals things hidden by magic. It glows a soft blue.
    %Note Adding items to the middle of the item list will break existing inventories, so take care to always ad to the end, if at all possible.
    %Limitation There can only be 64 items. They are stored as bits in a UINT64, which, as the name implies, has 64 bits.

:Start Abventure starts here

    This is the opening cell of the abventure. If no room is given, :Start is assumed. :Start does not have to be the first cell of the file, but it is recommended.
    Labels are a single word and may not contain spaces. Anything after the first word is considered the cell's title.
    In the absense of a title, the cell's name, except for the colon, is displayed instead.
    Each line is a a separate instruction. If it does not match any instruction, it is assumed to be adventure text to be displayed as is.
    Blank lines are ignored. Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed, so feel free to indent, or not.

    ?Ring-of-insight This line is only visible if you have the Ring Of Insight item.
    Item names can not have spaces in them, but any dashes are fine.

    >Elsewhere This is a link to a different cell named Elsewhere. The whole line is a link.
    ?Torch >Elsewhere This link only exists if you have the Tortch item.
    Note that instructions must have spaces between them!

:Elsewhere

    A cell continues until EOF, or until a new cell is declared with a new top-level name.
